   Simulated full-text document content for the Document Workspace viewer.

   This is a prototype: there are no real files behind the document names, so we
   synthesize realistic, readable body text per document type. Content is keyed
   off the filename (same buckets as classifyDocuments) and stays consistent with
   the demo case — Estate of Miller vs Logistics Co. / Evelyn Miller, a motor
   vehicle accident with cervical disc injury. In production this would be the
   actual extracted document text.
